Job Portal Backend - GraphQL API

This project is a backend for a Job Portal built using Django and GraphQL. It provides a robust API for managing job listings and applications, offering functionality for both job seekers and employers.

Key Features:

  Job Seekers can:
        Browse and search for job listings based on various filters (e.g., job title, location, category).
        Apply for job openings by submitting their profiles and resumes.
        Track their application status and view history.

   Employers can:
        Post new job openings with details such as job description, required skills, and location.
        Manage job listings, including editing or closing posts.
        Review applications submitted by job seekers and update application statuses.

The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability, and it connects to a PostgreSQL database to store job listings, applications, and user information.
